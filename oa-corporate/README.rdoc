= OmniAuth::Corporate

OmniAuth strategies for use in your intranet.

== Installation

To get just corporate functionality:

    gem install oa-corporate
    
For the full auth suite:

    gem install omniauth
    
== Stand-Alone Example

Use the strategy as a middleware in your application:

    require 'omniauth/corporate'
    
    use OmniAuth::Strategies::CAS, :server => 'http://cas.mycompany.com/cas'
    
Then simply direct users to '/auth/cas' to have them sign in via your company's CAS server.
See OmniAuth::Strategies::CAS::Configuration for more configuration options.


== OmniAuth Builder

If CAS is one of several authentication strategies, use the OmniAuth Builder:

    require 'omniauth/corporate'
    require 'omniauth/oauth'  # for Campfire
    require 'openid/store/filesystem'
    
    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :cas, :server => 'http://cas.mycompany.com/cas'
      provider :campfire
    end
